This project is designed with armips.exe at the center, and will eventually include grit to compile images.

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
1) Create a GitHub account.
2) Go to this repository, then fork.
3) Make changes.
4) Make pull request to this repository. Add comments as to what you did or I'll ignore it.
5) I'll look it over and accept it as I see fit.

HOW TO COMPILE STUFF
1) Download a .zip of the repository and extract it. It'll automatically be named Pokemon-Clover-master.
2) Put a CLEAN FireRed ROM in the main folder, and name it clover.gba.
3) Apply base.ips to clover.gba
4) Open your command prompt, navigate to Pokemon-Clover-master or whatever else you've renamed the folder to.
5) Type armips.exe main.asm -sym offsets.txt, then hit enter.

HOW TO ADD FILES
When we get images, I'll create a folder called images, and two subfolders called pic and bin. Put pictures into pic, grit will compress those and put them in bin.

Scripts that use our script_defines.asm file should be put in a folder called scripts, and ASM and C should go in a folder named source.

ASM AND SCRIPT STYLE
Comments are added through ;
Labels can only be defined once, and .orgs MUST be in order.
Instead of #org for scripts, use this style;
    start:
    call label
    end
    
    label:
    return
Defines will usually use either macros or equs.
    ; macro syntax
    .macro thing thing_param1
    .byte 0x0
    .byte \thing_param1
    .endmacro

    ; equ syntax
    define equ 0x1

.thumb is required at the top of every .asm file, and .close is needed at the end of every .asm file.
